      {Udacity}{Dhaka, Bangladesh}
      {Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree}{Nov 2019 - Feb 2020}
      \resumeItemListStart
      	\resumeItem{Capstone Project}{Implemented a LSTM model with 1D Convolution layers to detect Activities of Daily Living also know as Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using the WISDM accelerometer and gyroscope dataset. HAR has tremendous application in the Intellectual and Developmental Disability (ID/D) space where detecting human behavior can save lives. This nanodegree was sponsored by my employer and resulted in two contracts being signed, one with Garmin and the other with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).}

	\resumeSubheading
      {Therap (BD) Ltd.}{Dhaka, Bangladesh}
      {Software Engineer II, Machine Learning}{Oct 2019 - Present}
      \resumeItemListStart
		\resumeItem{Responsibilities}{ 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Initiated and helped establish the creation of a Machine Learning team. This allowed us to serve our customers in profound new ways whilst keeping ahead of the competition by widening our product portfolio.
				\item Implemented a fall detection system building on top of the work done on HAR. It is in the process of being deployed at scale since it is projected to reduce injurious incident reports by 3x.
				\item Implemented an object detection system which detects sharp and blunt objects among other items. This system has the potential to prevent patients from inflicting harm to others and to themselves. It was crucial in getting agencies to develop trust and share their data with us which was a major bottleneck right from the beginning.
				\item Implemented a face recognition system which can identify and flag unauthorized individuals. This strengthened existing security systems substantially.
			\end{itemize}

        \resumeItem{Related Technologies}

      {Therap (BD) Ltd.}{Dhaka, Bangladesh}
      {Software Engineer, Full Stack Web Development}{Oct 2016 - Sep 2019}
      \resumeItemListStart
		\resumeItem{Responsibilities}{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implemented numerous application modules from scratch, writing the backend, frontend, and database schema. These modules made us more competitive in terms of the number of features we offered allowing us to secure multiple State Contracts. 
				\item Reimplemented numerous older modules making them more performant, resilient and secure. This optimization improved server response time by 2x making pages load faster and more responsive.
				\item Implemented a multi-select drop-down JQuery widget (one of many) with application specific customizations. The widget improved existing code greatly in terms of extensibility and functionality. Its ease of use and clarity in design led to widespread adoption internally by other software development teams.

			{Machine Learning Consultant (Contractual, Remote)}{Jan 2019 - Mar 2019}
			\resumeItemListStart
				\resumeItem{Responsibilities}{
					\begin{itemize}
						\item We Are X was unable to scale to growing demand for its customer service business. To that end, I implemented a text classification machine learning model that can accurately classify customer queries written in Bengali and English. This improved existing customer service representative productivity by 3x allowing We Are X to meet market demand, keeping existing infrastructure intact.
