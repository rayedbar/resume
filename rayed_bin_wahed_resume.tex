      {Therap (BD) Ltd.}{Dhaka, Bangladesh}
      {Machine Learning Team Lead}{Oct 2019 - Present}
      \resumeItemListStart
		\resumeItem{Responsibilities}{ 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Established a machine learning team from the ground up by recruiting and training fresh university graduates to prototype new business initiatives and enhance our core service. Currently leading a team of 4 engineers.
				\item Implemented a fall detection system using an LSTM neural network and accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data. Our system alerts a caregiver when an IDD (Intellectual and Development Disability) patient has a fall event allowing the caregiver to attend to the patient approximately 3 times faster.
				\item Implemented a HAR (Human Activity Recognition) system using an LSTM neural network with a 1D Convolution head and accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data. Recording a patient's daily activities was a big challenge since it required a caregiver to continuously monitor the patient and manually enter the data. Our system automated that process and significantly improved both its speed and accuracy.
				\item Implemented an object detection system by fine-tuning the Detectron2 CNN model to detect sharp and blunt objects such as knives and baseball bats respectively. Once fully integrated with the care facilities' surveillance system, we hope to completely eliminate injurious incidents caused by patients using stray objects to inflict pain.
			\end{itemize}

      {Therap (BD) Ltd.}{Dhaka, Bangladesh}
      {Full Stack Software Engineer}{Oct 2016 - Sep 2019}
      \resumeItemListStart
		\resumeItem{Responsibilities}{
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implemented numerous application modules from scratch writing the backend, the frontend, and the database schema. These modules made us more competitive in terms of the number of features that we offered allowing us to secure multiple contracts. 
				\item Reimplemented numerous older modules making them more performant, resilient and secure. This optimization improved server response time by 2x making pages load faster and more responsive.
				\item Implemented a multi-select drop-down JQuery widget (one of many) with application specific customizations. The widget improved existing code greatly in terms of functionality and extensibility. Its ease of use and clarity in design led to widespread adoption internally by other software development teams.

			{Machine Learning Consultant (Contractual, Remote)}{Jan 2019 - Mar 2019}
			\resumeItemListStart
				\resumeItem{Responsibilities}{
					\begin{itemize}
						\item We Are X was unable to scale to growing demand for its online customer service business - responding to customer queries in social media platforms. To that end, I implemented a text classification model that could classify customer queries written in Bengali and English with 90\% accuracy working on a limited dataset. This improved customer service representative productivity by 3 times allowing We Are X to meet market demand keeping existing infrastructure intact.
